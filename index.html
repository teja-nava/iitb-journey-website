    <h2>My IIT Bombay Journey</h2>
    <p>
      When I first stepped into the sprawling and lush green campus of IIT Bombay, I felt a surge of excitement and nervous anticipation. Coming from a smaller town, it was overwhelming to suddenly be surrounded by some of the most brilliant minds in the country, iconic academic buildings, and a culture that values both excellence and freedom. I still remember dragging my suitcase into Hostel 15, the place I’d soon call home for the next few years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The initial days were filled with discovery — finding lecture halls, attending orientation programs, understanding course credits, and getting to know batchmates who came from all over India. I got lost more than a few times on campus but found help from seniors every step of the way. These early interactions planted the seeds of friendships that I cherish even today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, I settled into the rhythm of college life. From intense late-night study sessions and early morning classes to weekend hangouts at the lakeside and street food stalls near YP Gate — IIT Bombay has given me a blend of rigorous academics and personal freedom. The journey hasn’t always been smooth; there were tough times when I doubted myself, especially during exam weeks or when project deadlines loomed. But each challenge shaped me, made me more resilient, and taught me the value of persistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website is a heartfelt reflection of that journey. I’ve captured not just milestones and achievements, but also moments of growth, friendship, laughter, and introspection. Through every memory — whether captured in a photo, written in a course notebook, or etched into the walls of my hostel — IIT Bombay has given me a story I’ll proudly carry for life.
